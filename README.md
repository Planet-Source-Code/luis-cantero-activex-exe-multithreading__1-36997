## ActiveX EXE Multithreading


</div>

### Description

This is a list of issues that I had while implementing this technology in one of my programs and how to solve them. This information took me many days to collect and should save you about a week's worth of testing. To understand this you need Srideep Prasad's turorial on "Multithreading" (txtCodeId=24672), also available at PSC. I've tried all multithreading methods listed on PSC and I found this method to be the best.
